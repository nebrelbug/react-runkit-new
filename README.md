## Credit

This package is based off https://github.com/runkitdev/react-runkit. All credit goes to them.

In this project, we also bundle code from https://embed.runkit.com. This means you don't have to load it separately, but it also means our version may not be the latest.

### Differences from react-runkit

- No scrollbar appears when you press 'enter'
